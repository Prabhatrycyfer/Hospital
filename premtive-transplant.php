                        <p class="prgf-txt">A preemptive kidney transplant is when the patient receives a kidney transplant
                             before their kidney function deteriorates to the point of needing dialysis.
                            Preemptive kidney transplant is considered the preferred treatment for end-stage kidney disease. 
                            People who get a preemptive transplant receive their kidney when their health is generally good,
                             which allows them to stay healthier and live longer.
                            
                             There are both medical and economic advantages to preemptive transplants. This  transplant leads
                              to improved patient and graft survival. Several factors linked to the lower than expected rate
                               of preemptive kidney transplants are shortage of donor kidneys, lack of access to transplant centres, 
                               and low rates of physician referrals for the procedure among candidates of lower socioeconomic status.</p>

            <h3 class="blue-txt">What to expect</h3>
            <div class="inr-srvc-text">
                <p class="prgf-txt">If your doctor recommends a preemptive kidney transplant, you will have an evaluation. Your transplant team
                     will conduct several tests to determine if a preemptive kidney transplant is appropriate for you. A variety 
                     of factors will be considered, including:</p>
                     <ul>
                    <li class="prgf-txt">Your level of kidney function</li>
                    <li class="prgf-txt">Your overall health</li>
                    <li class="prgf-txt">Any chronic medical conditions that might affect the success of transplant</li>
                    <li class="prgf-txt">Availability of donor kidney</li>
                    <li class="prgf-txt">Ability to follow medical instructions and take anti-rejection medications for the rest of your life</li>
                </ul>

                <p class="prgf-txt">If you are approved for the transplant and a living-donor kidney is available, the living-donor 
                    kidney transplant procedure will be scheduled. If a living-donor kidney is unavailable, you will be placed on
                     a waiting list for a deceased-donor kidney transplant.</p>

        <div class="sdw-dv">
            <h3 class="blue-txt">Where does a kidney for preemptive transplant come from?</h3>
            <div class="inr-srvc-text">
                <p class="prgf-txt">A donated kidney comes from either a living donor or a deceased donor.
                     Usually, preemptive transplants are from living donors. A living donor is a person who
                      wants to donate a kidney when they are healthy and alive. If there is no available kidney
                       from a living donor, you may be able to get a kidney for preemptive transplantation
                        from a deceased donor, but you may have to wait longer.</p>

            <h3 class="blue-txt">Starting the process</h3>
            <div class="inr-srvc-text">
                <p class="prgf-txt">Once it is determined that preemptive transplantation is right for you and you have a
                     family member or friend willing to donate a kidney, the tests can be started right away. 
                    
                     After the evaluation is completed, if the living donor is a match for the transplant candidate, surgery can be scheduled.
                    
                     For many recipients, getting a preemptive transplant is a way to save time and money, keep working, 
                     as well as have the benefits of better physical health that come with a new kidney. If you want 
                     to consider preemptive transplantation, consult our specialists to understand the process 
                     and if it is a right fit for you.</p>
