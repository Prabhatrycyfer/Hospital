                        <p class="prgf-txt">Plasmapheresis is a process that filters the blood and removes harmful antibodies.
                            It is a procedure done similarly to dialysis; however, it specifically removes antibodies from
                            the plasma portion of the blood. Antibodies are part of the body’s natural defence system which
                            help destroy things that are not a natural part of our own bodies, like germs or bacteria.
                            Antibodies against blood proteins can lead to rejection after a blood-type incompatible transplant.
                            In severe cases, this could cause the kidney transplant to fail. Plasmapheresis before transplant
                            removes antibodies against the donor blood-type from the recipient, so they can’t attack and
                            damage the donated kidney.</p>

                        <p class="prgf-txt">After the transplant, the patient may require additional plasmapheresis
                            treatments and they will then take the similar immunosuppression medications as patients
                            receiving a blood type compatible kidney. At some centres, a biopsy may be done soon after
                            transplant to ensure antibodies are not causing rejection of the transplanted kidney.</p>

            <h3 class="blue-txt">What’s the purpose of plasmapheresis?</h3>
            <div class="inr-srvc-text">
                <p class="prgf-txt">Plasmapheresis can be used to treat a variety of autoimmune disorders including Myasthenia gravis,
                    Guillain-Barre syndrome, Wegener’s granulomatosis, Goodpasture syndrome, chronic inflammatory demyelinating
                    polyneuropathy, and Lambert-Eaton myasthenic syndrome. Additionally, plasmapheresis is done after kidney transplant
                    to treat cases of antibody-mediated rejection.</p>

                <p class="prgf-txt">In each of these disorders, the body has developed proteins called antibodies that are programmed
                    to identify cells and destroy them. These antibodies are in plasma. In people with an autoimmune disease,
                    instead of foreign cells such as a virus, antibodies will respond to cells inside the body that carry out
                    important functions.
                    Plasmapheresis can stop this process by removing the plasma that contains antibodies and replacing it with new plasma.</p>

            <h3 class="blue-txt">How is plasmapheresis administered?</h3>
            <div class="inr-srvc-text">
                <p class="prgf-txt">A medical professional performs plasmapheresis. A local anaesthetic will numb the affected area,
                    and the procedure should not cause pain. The doctor will then insert a small tube into a vein in the arm or
                    the groin. The tube will bring blood to the machine, which will collect it, treat it, and return it to the body.
                    Plasma exchange takes between 2 and 4 hours. A person will need to remain as still as possible to help the blood to flow smoothly.
                    It may help to watch television or read as a distraction.
                    A medical professional will check for side effects throughout the process. After the plasma exchange is complete,
                    the machine will be disconnected, and new blood tests will be performed. You may need as many as five treatments per week.
                    The frequency varies from condition to condition, and also depends on your overall health.</p>

                <p class="prgf-txt">You can optimise the success and minimise the symptoms of plasmapheresis by taking these steps:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li class="prgf-txt">Make sure to have a nutritious meal before treatment or donation.</li>
                    <li class="prgf-txt">Have a good night’s sleep the night before your procedure.</li>
                    <li class="prgf-txt">Drink plenty of fluids.</li>
                    <li class="prgf-txt">Get up to date with vaccinations for common infections. Work with your doctor to find out which vaccines you need.</li>
                    <li class="prgf-txt">Avoid smoking and tobacco use.</li>
                    <li class="prgf-txt">Eat a diet high in protein and low in phosphorus, sodium, and potassium in the days leading up to plasmapheresis.</li>

            <div class="inr-srvc-text">
                <p class="prgf-txt">If you’re receiving plasmapheresis as a treatment for weakness or an autoimmune disorder,
                    you may begin to feel relief in as little as a few days. For other conditions, it may take
                    a few weeks before you notice any changes in your symptoms.
                    Plasmapheresis will only provide short-term relief. Often the process will need to be repeated.
                    The frequency and length of results are highly dependent on your condition and its severity. Your doctor or nurse
                    can give you a general idea of how long plasmapheresis will be effective for and how frequently you need to use it.</p>

            <h3 class="blue-txt">What are the risks of plasmapheresis?</h3>
            <div class="inr-srvc-text">
                <p class="prgf-txt">Plasmapheresis does carry a risk of side effects. Usually, they are rare and generally mild.
                    The most common symptom is a drop in blood pressure. This is often accompanied by faintness, blurry vision,
                    dizziness, or feeling cold. There may be a risk of infection, blood clotting, allergic reaction. More serious
                    but uncommon risks include bleeding, which results from anti-clotting medications. Other more serious
                    risks include seizures, abdominal cramps, and tingling in the limbs.</p>
