                        <p class="prgf-txt">Kidney stones are hard deposits made from minerals such as calcium or
                            waste products such as uric acid. They start small, but they can grow
                            bigger as more minerals stick to them.

                            While some kidney stones often pass on their own without treatment through urine,
                            other stones that are bigger in size become painful or get stuck in your urinary tract.
                            These bigger stones need to be removed with the help of surgery.
                        
                            Possible causes of kidney stones include drinking too little water, exercising too much 
                            or too little, obesity, weight loss surgery, or consuming food with too much salt or sugar.
                             Infections and family history might be a factor for some people. Eating too much fructose also
                              increases risk of developing a kidney stone.</p>

            <div class="inr-srvc-text">
                <p class="prgf-txt">It is possible for kidney stones to not cause symptoms until it moves around within your
                     kidney or passes into your ureter. At that point, you may experience these symptoms:</p>

                <ul>
                    <li class="prgf-txt">Severe pain in the side and back, below the ribs</li>
                    <li class="prgf-txt">Pain that spreads to the lower abdomen and groin</li>
                    <li class="prgf-txt">Pain that comes in waves and fluctuates in intensity</li>
                    <li class="prgf-txt">Pain on urination</li>
                    <li class="prgf-txt">Pink, red or brown urine</li>
                    <li class="prgf-txt">Cloudy or foul-smelling urine</li>
                    <li class="prgf-txt">Nausea and vomiting</li>
                    <li class="prgf-txt">Constant urge to urinate</li>
                    <li class="prgf-txt">Urinating more often than usual</li>
                    <li class="prgf-txt">Fever and chills, if an infection is present</li>
                </ul>
                <p class="prgf-txt">As the stone moves through your urinary tract, the pain caused by it may change- for 
                    instance originating from a different location in the body or change in intensity.</p>

            <h3 class="blue-txt">Types of kidney stone surgeries</h3>
            <div class="inr-srvc-text">
                <p class="prgf-txt">These are the treatments used on kidney stones:</p>

                <h4 class="blue-txt">Shock wave lithotripsy</h4>
                <p class="prgf-txt">This is a non-invasive procedure where non-electrical shock waves are transmitted
                    through the body to break the kidney stones into smaller pieces so that they can pass through urine.</p>

                <h4 class="blue-txt">Ureteroscopy</h4>
                <p class="prgf-txt">In this, surgeons use a thin and flexible device called Ureteroscope to reach the kidney
                    through the bladder and ureter, when the stone is stuck within the ureter or bladder.
                    The laser fibre is used to transmit the Holmium energy that breaks up the kidney stone and the
                    surgeon then removes pieces from the urethra, while the smaller pieces pass through urine.</p>

                <h4 class="blue-txt">Percutaneous nephrolithotomy</h4>
                <p class="prgf-txt">The surgeon creates a tiny incision in the side or the back and insert a nephroscope
                    to locate and remove the kidney stones, in case of larger stones shock wave or lasers used to break them into the smaller pieces.</p>
            </div>
        </div>

        <div class="sdw-dv">
            <h3 class="blue-txt">Recovery</h3>
            <div class="inr-srvc-text">
                <p class="prgf-txt">The procedure takes only about 20â€“45 minutes to complete. You will likely be able
                    to resume your normal activities within two to three days of having an external shock wave
                    lithotripsy procedure or ureteroscopy, and one to two weeks after undergoing percutaneous nephrolithotomy.
                    Some of your activities may be limited due to discomfort, in case you have a temporary stent in place after surgery.</p>

            <h3 class="blue-txt">How to Prepare for Kidney Stone Surgery</h3>
            <div class="inr-srvc-text">
                <p class="prgf-txt">Your doctor will give you special instructions before your surgery, including:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li class="prgf-txt">Stop smoking, if you smoke, well in advance of surgery.</li>
                    <li class="prgf-txt">Stop taking certain medications like blood thinners that can make it hard for your blood to clot.</li>
                    <li class="prgf-txt">Do not eat or drink anything after midnight, prior to your surgery.</li>
                    <li class="prgf-txt">Ensure you have someone to drive you home after your procedure.</li>
                </ul>
                <p class="prgf-txt">A stent may be placed in your ureter up to a few weeks prior to your surgery.
                    This completely internal stent, allows your ureter to dilate or enlarge, and makes stone removal easier.
                    Stents may also relieve acute pain, enable any infection to drain, and allow antibiotic treatment before surgery. </p>

                <ul>
                    <li class="prgf-txt">If you underwent external shock wave lithotripsy, there may be soreness and bruising where the lithotripter touched your skin.</li>
                    <li class="prgf-txt">Discomfort and blood in your urine for a few days, especially if you have a ureteral stent in place.</li>
                    <li class="prgf-txt">You may feel pain and nausea as the remaining stone fragments pass through your urinary tract.</li>
