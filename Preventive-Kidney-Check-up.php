                        <p class="prgf-txt">Kidneys are one of the most important organs in a humanâ€™s body.
                            Located on either side of the spine, they are the size of the human fist.
                            The primary function of the kidney is to filter the waste material from the blood and 
                            pass it from the body as urine. However, the kidneys may get damaged if proper care is not taken.
                            Kidney diseases often have no symptoms, and can go undetected until very advanced.
                             But some simple tests can tell you if you have kidney disease.
                            It is essential to get tested because early detection and treatment can delay or
                             prevent the progression of kidney disease.

            <div class="inr-srvc-text">
                <h5>Urine Test</h5>
                <p class="prgf-txt">You can save your kidneys with a simple urine test. An Albumin Creatinine Ratio (ACR) 
                    estimates the amount of a type of protein, albumin, is in your urine.</p>

                    <h5>Blood Test</h5>
                <p class="prgf-txt">The Glomerular Filtration Rate (GFR)  is the best way to check kidney function. 
                    It tells how well your kidneys are working to remove wastes from your blood.</p>

                    <h5>Blood Urine Nitrogen (BUN)</h5>
                <p class="prgf-txt">This test examines the amount of nitrogen in your urine. It also checks whether 
                    there are still any waste products in your blood. Heavy dosage of aspirin and antibiotics
                     can lead to an increase in Nitrogen.</p>

                    <h5>Serum Creatinine Test</h5>
                <p class="prgf-txt">Generally, the kidney completely filters the creatinine from the blood.
                     This test checks if there is creatinine building in your body.</p>

                <p class="prgf-txt">Approximately 1 of 3 adults with diabetes and 1 of 5 adults with high blood 
                    pressure may have chronic kidney disease (CKD). In addition to diabetes and high blood pressure, 
                    other factors that increase the risk of kidney disease are heart disease, obesity, a family history
                     of CKD, and being age 60 or older. Kidney infections and a physical injury can also cause kidney disease.</p>
