                        <p class="prgf-txt">Peritoneal dialysis is one type of dialysis treatment for kidney failure.
                            A soft plastic tube (catheter) is placed in your belly by surgery that transports fluid in
                            or out of your body.
                            A sterile cleansing solution called dialysate is put into your belly through this catheter.
                            This solution is a type of cleansing liquid that contains water, salt and other additives.
                            The tissue that covers most of the organs in your belly (the peritoneum) acts as a filter
                            for this process.<br>
                            The dialysate will stay in your belly for a period of time, usually four to six hours,
                            while it cleans your blood. This time is called dwell time. Then, the used dialysate will
                            be drained out of your belly and refilled with fresh dialysate. This process is called an
                            exchange.
                            You may do these exchanges yourself or with the help of a machine.
                            Peritoneal dialysis takes place at home.

            <h3 class="blue-txt">What happens before and after peritoneal dialysis?</h3>
            <div class="inr-srvc-text">
                <p class="prgf-txt">Before: About three weeks before you start peritoneal dialysis, you will have
                    a minor surgical procedure. A surgeon inserts a catheter through your belly and into the peritoneum.
                    This catheter stays in place permanently. A healthcare provider will teach you how to perform
                    peritoneal dialysis at home and prevent infections at the catheter site.<br>
                    After: The liquid in your belly can make you feel bloated or full. You might feel uncomfortable,
                    but the treatment isn’t painful. Your stomach may stick out more than usual when it’s filled with
                    fluid.</p>

        <div class="sdw-dv">
            <h3 class="blue-txt">Will there be activity restrictions while I am on dialysis?</h3>
            <div class="inr-srvc-text">
                <p class="prgf-txt">Many patients on dialysis continue to live active lives. When you travel,
                    your healthcare provider can help arrange for you to get dialysis at a centre at your new location.
                    If you do either type of self-dialysis, you can take dialysis solution bags and the portable home
                    dialysis machine (if needed) with you.<br>
                    People using peritoneal dialysis may need to limit certain physical activities when the
                    abdomen fills with dialysis fluid. Otherwise, exercising is typically OK for people on dialysis.
                    You should consult your doctor about participating in specific activities or sports.

            <h3 class="blue-txt">Types of peritoneal dialysis</h3>
            <div class="inr-srvc-text">
                <p class="prgf-txt">There are two kinds of peritoneal dialysis:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li class="prgf-txt">Continuous Ambulatory Peritoneal Dialysis (CAPD)</li>
                    <li class="prgf-txt">Automated Peritoneal Dialysis (APD)</li>
                </ul>
                <p class="prgf-txt">The basic treatment is the same for each. However, the number and the way the
                    treatments are done make each method different.</p>
                <p class="prgf-txt">CAPD is "continuous," machine-free and done while you go about your normal
                    activities such as work. The treatment is
                    done by placing about two quarts of cleansing fluid into your belly and later draining it. This is
                    done by hooking up a
                    plastic bag of cleansing fluid to the tube in your belly. Raising the plastic bag to shoulder level
                    causes gravity to pull
                    the fluid into your belly. When empty, the plastic bag is removed and thrown away.

                    When an exchange is finished, the fluid (which now has wastes removed from your blood) is drained
                    from your belly and disposed of. This process is usually repeated three- five times in a 24-hour
                    period while you are awake. Each exchange takes about 30 to 40 minutes. Some patients prefer doing
                    their exchanges at mealtimes and bedtime.</p>

                    <p class="prgf-txt">In APD, a machine (cycler) delivers and then drains the cleansing fluid for you. 
                        The treatment is usually done at night while you sleep.</p>

            <h3 class="blue-txt">The pros and cons of being on peritoneal dialysis</h3>
            <div class="inr-srvc-text">
                <p class="prgf-txt">Some doctors feel that CAPD and APD have several benefits when compared to
                    hemodialysis.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li class="prgf-txt">With continuous dialysis, you can control extra fluid more easily, and this may
                        reduce stress on the heart and blood vessels.</li>
                    <li class="prgf-txt">You are able to eat more and use fewer medications.</li>
                    <li class="prgf-txt">You can participate in more daily activities and it is easier to work or
                        travel.</li>
                </ul>
                <p class="prgf-txt">However, there are some people for whom peritoneal dialysis may not be appropriate.
                </p>

                <ul>
                    <li class="prgf-txt">The abdomen or belly of some people, particularly those who are morbidly obese
                        or those with multiple prior
                        abdominal surgeries, may make peritoneal dialysis treatments difficult or impossible.</li>
                    <li class="prgf-txt">Peritonitis (infection of abdomen) is an occasional complication although
                        should be infrequent with appropriate precautions.</li>
                    <li class="prgf-txt">Peritoneal dialysis is not for everyone. People must receive training and be
                        able to perform correctly
                        each of the steps of the treatment. A trained helper may also be used.</li>
                </ul>
                <p class="prgf-txt">When making a decision about the type of treatment, you should take into
                    consideration that peritoneal
                    dialysis is usually a daily process, similar to the working of the kidney and may be more gentle
                    with fluid removal
                    from the body. Peritoneal dialysis is an effective form of dialysis, and has been proven to be as
                    good as hemodialysis.</p>
