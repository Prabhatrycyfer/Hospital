                            taken and looked at with special microscopes. The test helps your doctor identify the
                            type of kidney disease you have, its severity, and the best treatment for it.
                            A renal biopsy is used to monitor the effectiveness of kidney treatments and see
                            if there are any complications following a transplant.</p>

            <h3 class="blue-txt">How is the biopsy done?</h3>
            <div class="inr-srvc-text">
                <p class="prgf-txt">During a kidney biopsy, a doctor collects a sample of tissue from your kidney.
                    Most biopsies are done through your back, although people with a transplanted kidney
                    have the biopsy through their lower abdomen.</p>

                <p class="prgf-txt">The methods used to take the sample are:</p>

                <p class="prgf-txt"> <strong>Percutaneous biopsy : </strong> this more common type of kidney biopsy, a doctor
                    numbs the skin located over the kidney and inserts a needle to take a small tissue sample
                    from the kidney. They use ultrasound imaging to guide the needle to the best location in the kidney.</p>

                <p class="prgf-txt"><strong>Open biopsy : </strong>In an open biopsy, a doctor makes an incision, removes tissue from the kidney,
                    and closes the incision with stitches. Your doctor will give you anaesthesia so you do not feel pain during the procedure.
                    This type of biopsy is rare except at the time of kidney transplant.</p>

                <p class="prgf-txt">The entire procedure, from start to finish, usually lasts about one hour.
                    The kidney sample is then sent to a pathology lab to check for any signs of disease. </p>

        </div>

        <div class="sdw-dv">
            <h3 class="blue-txt">Preparation for the biopsy and after the test</h3>
            <div class="inr-srvc-text">
                <p class="prgf-txt"><strong>Before : </strong>For two weeks before the biopsy, you should not take over-the-counter
                    pain medicines, or other medicines that may cause thinning of the blood. These medicines can change the way
                    the blood clots and increase the risk of bleeding. For the same reason, you should stop taking some supplements
                    such as fish oil. Blood and urine samples are usually taken before the kidney biopsy to make sure you do
                    not have an infection or other condition. Your doctor may also want you to change other medications before the biopsy.
                    You may be told to not eat or drink for eight hours before the procedure.</p>

                <p class="prgf-txt"><strong>After : </strong> a standard biopsy, you will be observed for 1-2 hours in the recovery
                    area to ensure you are well, can drink fluids, and pass urine comfortably. When released from the biopsy area,
                    you should go directly home and stay indoors overnight. The next day you can walk or drive a car as needed.
                    It will be important to avoid strenuous activity or heavy lifting for up to another two days after the procedure.
                    If an open biopsy is required, your doctor will give you further instructions.</p>

            <h3 class="blue-txt">Possible risks of kidney biopsy</h3>
            <div class="inr-srvc-text">
                <p class="prgf-txt">The risks of kidney biopsy are very small, but they should be discussed with your doctor.
                    As in other medical and surgical procedures, certain complications may happen even though every effort
                    is taken to prevent them. A blood transfusion may be needed if serious bleeding occurs. Rarely,
                    surgery may be needed to fix a blood vessel that is damaged during the procedure.Very rarely a urine
                    infection may occur, especially in patients with a history of frequent urine infections. </p>

            <h3 class="blue-txt">Test results</h3>
            <div class="inr-srvc-text">
                <p class="prgf-txt">After the kidney sample is taken, it is sent to pathologists who will read and interpret your kidney biopsy.
                    It often takes three to five days to get the full biopsy results.
                    In some cases, you may have a partial or full report within 24 hours or less.
                    A kidney biopsy result can reveal medical conditions that may impair kidney function, such as an
                    immunologic disease and help a doctor evaluate how well a donated kidney is working after a transplant. 
                    It aids your doctor in determining the most effective treatment for kidney disease. </p>
