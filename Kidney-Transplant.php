                        <p class="prgf-txt">Any patient who has established renal failure or End Stage Renal Disease
                            (ESRD) over three months, has three treatment options available: hemodialysis,
                            peritoneal dialysis and kidney transplantation. Many patients feel that a
                            successful kidney transplant provides a better quality of life and greater
                            freedom with increased energy levels and a less restricted diet. To decide
                            the best treatment for you, speak to your doctor, nurse, family members and people
                            who have already had a kidney transplant. In some situations when doctors feel that
                            transplant is needed in the near future, before beginning dialysis, patients can go
                            for preemptive kidney transplantation.
                            There are two types of kidney transplants: those that come from living donors (your family,
                            spouse, close friend, and in some cases a stranger) and those that come from unrelated
                            donors who have died (non-living donors).</p>

                <p class="prgf-txt">Usually, when the recipient receives the kidney from a genetically related healthy
                    individual, the chance of success is around 95 per cent at the end of one year,
                    provided there are no other adverse factors. The success of a transplant also depends
                    on how healthy the received kidney is, what is the primary disease causing the native kidney
                    failure, if the donor and recipient are well matched and other variables.</p>

            <div class="inr-srvc-text">
                <p class="prgf-txt">Donor's surgery can be done in two ways:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li class="prgf-txt">First is through a laparoscopic donor nephrectomy, with minimal incision and discomfort post surgery.
                        The donor is discharged on day three or four after this surgery.</li>
                    <li class="prgf-txt">The second way is open surgical donor nephrectomy in which the donor has a long incision on the flank,
                        making it more painful and uncomfortable. In this case, the donor is discharged around the fifth or sixth day post
                        surgery and can resume work in 15-20 days.</li>
                </ul>
                <p class="prgf-txt">Both open and laparoscopic nephrectomy last about 2 to 3 hours. They are performed using general
                    anaesthesia, which means the patient will be asleep during the entire surgery.</p>

            <h3 class="blue-txt">Risks involved in transplant surgery</h3>
            <div class="inr-srvc-text">
                <p class="prgf-txt">Overall, more than 80-90 per cent of patients do well after a transplant. Sometimes, the
                    transplanted kidney is not taken up well by the recipientâ€™s body, leading to rejection. This is
                    mostly managed with anti rejection medicines, but five to ten per cent patients may still face major
                    problems such as life threatening infections due to lowered immunity. Some patients may have bleeding
                    or other surgical complications, with one to two per cent risk of dying as they could lose the graft kidney,
                    but this is very rare. Patients can discuss with their doctors and tailor their immunosuppression to a certain
                    limit according to their finances. High potency drugs that help minimise rejection are usually taken in the
                    initial two to three years; if this period passes well, then the intensity of immunosuppression is gradually decreased.</p>

        <div class="sdw-dv">
            <h3 class="blue-txt">How long does a patient require hospital stay?</h3>
            <div class="inr-srvc-text">
                <p class="prgf-txt">Normally, with no adverse event, after transplant the hospital stay for the recipient
                    should not be more than fifteen days and around five days for the donor.</p>
            </div>
        </div>

        <div class="sdw-dv">
            <h3 class="blue-txt">What is the post surgical treatment regime ?</h3>
            <div class="inr-srvc-text">
                <p class="prgf-txt">Most of the transplant medicines will likely be reduced or stopped after transplantation. 
                    If the patient has severe hypertension before the transplantation and is on multiple drugs, then it is
                     likely that once the transplanted kidney starts working well, these medicines would be reduced. The
                      patient would then require only a single antihypertensive drug or no medicines at all. Since the new 
                      kidney can produce erythropoietin hormone and balance calcium, there is no need for iron or calcium injections.

                    Kidney transplants, like other treatments, require following special diet guidelines. A patient who was on dialysis 
                    before may find this new diet less restricted. The period of time this diet must be followed varies. After
                     closely monitoring your progress, our doctor and dietitian will change your diet as needed.
