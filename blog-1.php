                                job, a sedentary lifestyle and
                                eating the wrong food at the wrong time took a toll on his body, eventually making
                                health problems and hard decisions inevitable.
                                Advised a kidney transplant, he tried to stall what appeared to be a formidable line of

                                “I endured two years of dialysis before going for a robotic kidney transplant. It was
                                very painful and the long hours made it even more so.
                                I used to go at 4am and the exercise took 4 hours,” he said.

                            </p>

                            <p class="prgf-txt"> What complicated matters
                                further was the fact that he had cardiac issues. Waiting to meet the doctor who saw him
                                out of the mess, he recalled, “Two to three years ago my keratine levels shot up and
                                that affected the heart.”</p>

                            <p class="prgf-txt">Things have come a long way now. His ordeal has ended, thanks to the
                                intervention of Dr
                                Priyadarshi Ranjan, one of the top 10 kidney transplant surgeons in the world.</p>

                            <p class="prgf-txt"> Maintaining a stoic front despite the years of pain and turmoil he just

                                Sarvesh betrayed emotion with a hint of a smile at the mention of Dr Ranjan.</p>

                            <p class="prgf-txt">
                                “He examined me with care and explained the problem as well as the solution very
                                minutely, leaving no doubts. It was due to him that I got over my fear of kidney
                                transplant. After the robotic kidney transplant, I discovered that there was nothing to
                                fear anyway. I am back on my feet and am set to travel to Jalandhar after meeting him,”
                                he said.</p>

                            <p class="prgf-txt"> <strong>A caregiver’s dilemma</strong><br>
                                Sarvesh’s wife Meenakshi Sharma, who donated her kidney to her husband, underlined the
                                poignant situation of caregivers in the family.</p>

                            <p class="prgf-txt">“We have been through a lot but it started in a simple manner. He had a
                                sense of nausea while eating.
                                Someone suggested a homeopath in Delhi and we took the advice. He was on homeopathy for
                                two years but we had to
                                discontinue the course during the Covid lockdown. Afterwards, his condition deteriorated
                                and he had to go for dialysis,” she said.</p>

                            <p class="prgf-txt">If dialysis was difficult for Sarvesh, it was even more so for his wife.
                                “Watching him was tough.
                                There were these needles and associated conditions that cropped up like fistula, it made
                                things terribly hard to bear,” she said.</p>

                            <p class="prgf-txt"> <strong>The good doctor</strong><br>
                                The years of suffering, hope mingled with despair culminated in the meeting with Dr
                                Priyadarshi Ranjan.</p>

                            <p class="prgf-txt">a matter of hours. There is no major incision as no major muscle is cut,
                                which leaves patients back on their feet the next day.</p>

                            <p class="prgf-txt"> <strong>Technique with compassion</strong><br>
                                With his characteristically warm smile, Dr Priyadarshi Ranjan uses empathy with cutting
                                edge technology to turn patients’ lives around.</p>

                            <p class="prgf-txt">“The robotic kidney transplant technique uses flexible robotic arms
                                which have much more scope of movement than human fingers,
                                affording a quick and clean procedure that heals faster. Limited hospital stay and
                                faster recovery also minimizes the economic and physical
                                toll of the procedure,” he explains.</p>

                            <p class="prgf-txt">Working tirelessly to give the best possible treatment to his patients,
                                Dr Ranjan feels fatigue melt away when he sees them
                                walking around happily the next day, almost incredulous at how good and recovered they
                                feel so soon after the procedure.</p>

                            <p class="prgf-txt"> “Although I explain to them that they will be up and about in no time,
                                they get surprised to feel healthy and active
                                the very next day and the expression of surprise and happiness on their faces gives me
                                immense pleasure,” he says.</p>

                            <p class="prgf-txt"> recalled, “Two to three years ago my keratine levels shot up and that

                            <p class="prgf-txt">“What makes him a good doctor is not merely his clinical prowess, though
                                there is no doubting that, but the
                                warmth and compassion that he approaches his patients with. He is a truly capable doctor
                                and a good human being.
                                Despite his extremely busy schedule, he would listen patiently to us, addressing all our

                                for granted. When he told us about the robotic kidney transplant, we let go of all

                            <p class="prgf-txt"> <strong>The Scarless Magnified Advanced Robotic Kidney Transplant or
                                    SMART is aptly named,
                                    considering that it is a line of treatment that does away with any kind of pain and
                                    discomfort a patient may
                                    feel while speeding up the healing process dramatically.</strong><br></p>

                            <p class="prgf-txt">In fact, the patient has little to show for such a major procedure,
                                looking and feeling recovered in</p>

                            <p class="prgf-txt">Ironically, it is a robot that makes such humane treatment possible. “A
                                robot enables me to give my best to my
                                patients in terms of precision while minimizing the surgical trauma to their body to
                                have them recover uneventfully,” said Dr Ranjan.</p>
