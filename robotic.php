                <p class="prgf-txt">Six decades back, traditional open kidney transplant surgery was one of the most
                    surgically
                    challenging procedures and it had no major improvements for a long time. With the advent and
                    evolution
                    of Robotic surgery over the past decade, more and more specialised Urologists are getting trained
                    and
                    specialised in kidney transplantation. There is substantial improvement in the success rates of
                    kidney
                    transplant in terms of pain, loss of blood, fatigue, scarring, surgical complications and hospital
                    stay.
                    The results after a RAKT transplant procedure have revolutionised the overall outcomes in kidney
                    transplantation.

            <div class="inr-srvc-text">
                <p class="prgf-txt">The magnificently created Davinci robotic surgical system is used by our skilled
                    team of transplant
                    specialists. This team is led by one of the most experienced and highly qualified urologist
                    transplant
                    surgeons with an experience of more than a thousand kidney transplants. The robot offers up to 10
                    times
                    magnification than a traditional transplant, enhancing the surgical precision ten fold. The SMART
                    surgery is
                    significantly more accurate than the naked eye. The flexibility of robotic arms and instruments
                    enable the surgeon
                    to suture the blood vessels in a more precise manner than ever. Overall, it provides the most
                    successful
                    results after a kidney transplant.</p>

            <h3 class="blue-txt">Fewer complications</h3>
            <div class="inr-srvc-text">
                <p class="prgf-txt">The SMART transplant has been successful in minimising the surgical complications
                    related to
                    a transplant such as pain, blood loss, wound infections, hernia formation and muscle weakness. You
                    can barely
                    see the incision after three months and surgical site infection rates are almost close to zero. Most
                    of the
                    patients start eating the next day and are not bound to the hospital bed one day after transplant.
                    This type
                    of kidney transplant has also been safely conducted in a number of patients who are obese, diabetic
                    or heart patients.</p>

            <div class="inr-srvc-text">
                <p class="prgf-txt">The entire procedure is done using tiny buttonhole incisions, minimising the trauma
                    to the body.
                    Thus, the healing is better and quicker as compared to a traditional open transplant, where the
                    incision may
                    stretch up to 20-25 cms. Since no muscles are cut, the blood loss is minimised too. Most patients
                    are
                    able to be up and around the very first day after transplantation.</p>

                <p class="prgf-txt">Unlike the traditional transplant where the recovery process is longer,
                    an RAKT transplantation patient recovers way quicker. The SMART incision used to place the kidney
                    inside is hardly 5 cm, smartly positioned in the lower part of the body. No muscles are actually
                    cut during the procedure which means the trauma to the body is minimal. The painkiller requirement
                    is very low as compared to an open transplant too.</p>
