                            They also make substances that keep your body healthy. In hemodialysis, a machine filters wastes,
                            salts and fluid from your blood when your kidneys can no longer perform this function. In most cases,
                            this happens when you have only 10 to 15 percent of kidney function left and experience symptoms like
                            nausea, vomiting, swelling and fatigue. However, even if you don't have these symptoms yet, you can
                            still have a high level of wastes in your blood that is toxic to your body.
                            Hemodialysis is one way to treat advanced kidney failure and can help you live an active life 
                            despite failing kidneys. At Meliora,
                            you will work closely with a healthcare team, including a kidney specialist and other professionals who 
                            are experienced in managing hemodialysis. </p>

            <h3 class="blue-txt">How does hemodialysis work?</h3>
            <div class="inr-srvc-text">
                <p class="prgf-txt">Hemodialysis is a procedure in which a dialysis machine and a special filter 
                    called an artificial kidney, or a dialyzer, are used to clean your blood. Two needles 
                    are inserted into your arm through the access site and taped in place. Each needle is attached
                     to a plastic tube that connects to a dialyzer. Through one tube, the dialyzer filters your
                     blood a few ounces at a time, into a cleansing fluid called dialysate. The second tube allows the filtered blood to return to your body.
                     The two parts of the filter or dialyzer are separated by a thin membrane. Blood cells, protein and other important
                      things remain in your blood as they are too big to pass through the membrane. Smaller waste products in the blood, 
                      such as urea, creatinine, potassium and extra fluid pass through the membrane and are washed away.</p>

        <div class="sdw-dv">
            <h3 class="blue-txt">How long will each hemodialysis treatment last?</h3>
            <div class="inr-srvc-text">
                <p class="prgf-txt">In a dialysis centre, hemodialysis is usually done 3 times per week for about 4 hours at a time. 
                    If a person chooses to do hemodialysis at home, they may do dialysis treatment more frequently, 4-7 
                    times per week for shorter hours each time.
                    Your doctor’s prescription will tell you how much treatment you need. Your dialysis care team will
                     monitor your treatment with monthly lab tests to ensure you are getting the right amount of dialysis. 
                     One of the measures your dialysis care team may use is called urea reduction ratio (URR). Another
                      measure is called Kt/V. You can ask your dialysis care team what measure they use and what your number is.
                       To ensure that you are getting enough dialysis:</p>
                       <ul>
                    <li class="prgf-txt">your Kt/V should be at least 1.2 or</li>
                    <li class="prgf-txt">your URR should be at least 65 percent.</li>
                </ul>

            <h3 class="blue-txt">Can I have hemodialysis at home?</h3>
            <div class="inr-srvc-text">
                <p class="prgf-txt">Possibly. You can have your hemodialysis treatment at home where you will be the one doing your treatment.
                     At home, you may be better able to fit your treatments into your daily schedule. But home hemodialysis is not
                      a good fit for everyone. You need to learn a lot about it. You need to be willing to be responsible for your own treatment.
                       When you and/or your care partner can pass the training and learn to place your needles, you should be able to do home hemodialysis.</p>

            <h3 class="blue-txt">What is the outlook for someone on dialysis?</h3>
            <div class="inr-srvc-text">
                <p class="prgf-txt">It’s possible to live 10 to 20 years on dialysis. The outlook depends largely on how well you follow
                     your treatment plan, your age, overall health, the cause of kidney failure and other factors. If you get a kidney 
                     transplant, you can stop dialysis when your new kidney starts working.</p>

            <h3 class="blue-txt">Is hemodialysis painful or uncomfortable?</h3>
            <div class="inr-srvc-text">
            <p class="prgf-txt">When you begin hemodialysis, the needles put in your fistula or graft may feel uncomfortable. 
                Most patients get used to this in time. Your dialysis care team will make sure that you are as comfortable 
                s possible during your treatment. Symptoms like cramps, headaches, nausea or dizziness are usually not common,
                 but if you do have any of them, ask your dialysis care team if any of the following steps could help you</p>
                <ul>
                    <li class="prgf-txt">Slow down your fluid removal, which could increase your dialysis time.</li>
                    <li class="prgf-txt">Increase the amount of sodium in your dialysate.</li>
                    <li class="prgf-txt">Check your high blood pressure medications.</li>
                    <li class="prgf-txt">Adjust your dry weight, or target weight.</li>
                    <li class="prgf-txt">Cool the dialysate a little.</li>
                    <li class="prgf-txt">Use a special medication to help prevent low blood pressure during dialysis.</li>
                </ul>
                <p class="prgf-txt">A way to help yourself is by following your diet and fluid allowances.
                     The need to remove too much fluid during dialysis is one of the things that may make you feel uncomfortable during your treatment.</p>
