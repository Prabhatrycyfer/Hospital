                        <p class="prgf-txt">Kidney cancer is cancer that originates in the kidneys. It happens when healthy cells in one
                            or both kidneys grow out of control and form a lump. In adults, the most common type of kidney cancer is
                            renal cell carcinoma whereas in young children, a different kind of kidney cancer called Wilms' tumour is more likely to develop.
                            Kidney cancers are usually detected during procedures for other diseases or conditions. Imaging techniques such
                            as computerised tomography (CT) may lead to the discovery of more kidney cancers.</p>

                        <p class="prgf-txt">The exact causes of renal cell carcinoma is not known but doctors know that kidney cancer
                            begins when some kidney cells acquire mutations in their DNA. The mutations cause the cells to grow
                            and divide rapidly. The accumulating abnormal cells form a tumour that can extend beyond the kidney.
                            Some cells can break off and spread (metastasize) to other parts of the body.</p>

                <p class="prgf-txt"><strong>Blood and urine tests-</strong> Tests of your blood and your urine may give your doctor
                    an idea about what's causing your signs and symptoms.</p>

                <p class="prgf-txt"><strong>Imaging tests-</strong> Imaging tests allow your doctor to visualise a kidney tumour or abnormality.
                    These tests include ultrasound, computerised tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI).</p>

                <p class="prgf-txt"><strong>Biopsy (removing a sample of kidney tissue)-</strong>In some situations, your doctor may recommend a procedure
                    to remove a small sample of cells (biopsy) from a suspicious area of your kidney. The sample is tested in a lab to look for signs of cancer.
                    This procedure isn't always needed.</p>

                <p class="prgf-txt">Once kidney cancer is diagnosed, the next step is to determine the stage of the cancer.
                    Staging tests for kidney cancer may include additional CT scans or other imaging tests.

                    Your doctor then assigns a number, called a stage, to your cancer. </p>
                <p class="prgf-txt"><strong>Stage I.</strong> At this stage, the tumour can be up to 2 3/4 inches (7 centimetres) in diameter.
                    The tumour is confined to the kidney.</p>

                <p class="prgf-txt"><strong>Stage II.</strong> A stage II kidney cancer is larger than a stage I tumour,
                    but is still confined to the kidney.</p>

                <p class="prgf-txt"><strong>Stage III.</strong> At this stage, the tumour extends beyond the kidney to the surrounding
                    tissue and may also have spread to a nearby lymph node.</p>

                <p class="prgf-txt"><strong>Stage IV.</strong> Cancer spreads outside the kidney, to multiple lymph nodes or
                    to distant parts of the body, such as the bones, brain, liver or lungs.</p>

            <h3 class="blue-txt">Types of kidney cancer?</h3>
            <div class="inr-srvc-text">
                <p class="prgf-txt">The main type of kidney cancer is known as renal cell carcinoma (RCC). About 9 out of 10 kidney
                    cancer tumours are this type. Anyone who has this type of kidney cancer, may have more than one tumour
                    in one or both kidneys. These may be large by the time they are diagnosed. Mostly, kidney cancer is
                    found before it has spread to other organs.</p>

                <p class="prgf-txt">There are different types of RCC. A pathologist identifies these types by
                    looking at the cancer cells under a microscope. The types of RCC include:</p>

                <p class="prgf-txt"><strong>Clear cell- </strong>The most common type of RCC. The cancer cells look pale or clear.</p>

                <p class="prgf-txt"><strong>Papillary- </strong>This is the second most common type of RCC in which the tumour has tiny fingerlike growths.</p>

                <p class="prgf-txt"><strong>Chromophobe- </strong>A rare form of RCC. The cells are larger than other types of RCC.</p>

                <p class="prgf-txt"><strong>Collecting ducts- </strong> This is also a rare form of RCC. The cancer cells look like irregular tubes.</p>

                <p class="prgf-txt"><strong>Unclassified- </strong>This includes tumours that have cells from more than 1 type of cancer, including tumours
                    with cells that don’t fit into the other categories.</p>

        <div class="sdw-dv">
            <h3 class="blue-txt">Other less-common types of kidney cancers include:</h3>
            <div class="inr-srvc-text">
                <p class="prgf-txt"><strong>Transitional cell carcinoma.</strong>This is also known as urothelial carcinoma. It starts in an area
                    called the renal pelvis, where the ureter and kidney meet. This type of kidney cancer can act and look like bladder cancer.</p>

                <p class="prgf-txt"><strong>Wilms’ tumour.</strong>This cancer most always occurs in children. It's very rare in adults.</p>

                <p class="prgf-txt"><strong>Renal sarcoma. </strong>This very rare type of kidney cancer begins in the blood vessels and connective tissue around the kidneys.</p>

                <p class="prgf-txt">Several types of kidney tumours are not cancerous (benign), including renal cell adenoma,
                    renal oncocytoma, and angiomyolipoma. These tumours may still affect kidney function and can cause
                    pain as well as other symptoms, but the cells usually do not spread to other organs.</p>

            <h3 class="blue-txt">How is kidney cancer treated?</h3>
            <div class="inr-srvc-text">
                <p class="prgf-txt"><strong>Surgery:</strong> Surgery to remove the kidney is called a nephrectomy. This is the most
                    common treatment for kidney cancer. Different types of nephrectomy procedures include:<br><br>

                    <strong>Radical nephrectomy:</strong> The whole kidney is removed, along with the adrenal gland and tissue around the kidney.
                    Sometimes, lymph nodes in the area are also removed.<br>

                    <strong>Simple nephrectomy.</strong> Only the kidney is removed.<br>

                    <strong>Partial nephrectomy. </strong> Only the cancerous part of the kidney is removed.
                </p>

                <p class="prgf-txt"><strong>Radiation therapy: </strong> Radiation therapy uses high-energy X-rays to kill cancer cells.
                 It is sometimes used to relieve pain when kidney cancer has spread to the bone.</p>

                <p class="prgf-txt"><strong>Targeted drug therapy: </strong>Targeted therapy uses drugs that attack specific parts of cancer cells.
                 These drugs work differently from standard chemotherapy drugs and often have less severe side effects. This is the first line of
                  treatment for advanced kidney cancer.</p>

                  <p class="prgf-txt"><strong>Biological therapy (also called immunotherapy): </strong> Biological therapy is 
                  a treatment that uses the body's own immune system to fight cancer.</p>

                  <p class="prgf-txt"><strong>Chemotherapy: </strong> Chemotherapy is the use of drugs to kill cancer cells. Unfortunately,
                   kidney cancer is often resistant to chemotherapy drugs.</p>

                  <p class="prgf-txt"><strong>Arterial embolization: </strong>Arterial embolization is a procedure in which small pieces of
                   a special gelatin sponge, or other material, are injected through a catheter to clog the main renal blood vessel. 
                   This procedure shrinks the tumour by depriving it of the oxygen-carrying blood and other substances it needs to grow.
                    It may also be used before an operation to make surgery easier or to provide relief from pain when removal of the tumour is not possible.</p>
