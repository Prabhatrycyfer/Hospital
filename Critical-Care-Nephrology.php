                            to develop novel treatments to prevent, manage, and cure acute disorders involving kidney function,
                             fluid and electrolyte imbalance in critically ill patients.
                            It allows doctors to treat patients with kidney ailments, metabolic imbalances, acid-base disorders,
                             poisoning, major organ dysfunction, severe sepsis, and other pathological conditions. 
                             These medical professionals are highly qualified and trained in the latest innovations. 
                             The advanced approaches are proving effective in improving the outcomes of people suffering from acute renal failure.
                            The care of patients in ICUs has become increasingly complex over the last two decades.
                             Our patients benefit from the proficiency of doctors who specialise in critical care medicine and have
                              a high degree of interest in researching innovative treatments to offer better care for people with renal diseases.

                <p class="prgf-txt">Acute kidney injury (AKI) is a challenging medical condition which affects lakhs of individuals.
                     It is a sudden episode of kidney failure or damage that happens within a few hours or a few days.
                      Most of the cases of AKI are caused by reduced blood flow to the kidneys, usually in patients who
                       are suffering from a health condition. The reduction in blood flow could be a result of severe dehydration 
                       from excessive vomiting, diarrhoea, or low blood volume after bleeding. Acute kidney injury is common in 
                       patients who are in the hospital for a prolonged period, in intensive care units, and especially in older adults.</p>
